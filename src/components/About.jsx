      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is Tim and I design webpages. More than that I am also big into cooking and make my own bread. In my free time I'm a huge gamer with League of Legends being my favorite. I am a very proud cat dad as well. My partner and I travel a lot and enjoy seeing concerts together. I'd say Im well rounded in my skills and I enjoy learning new things. I bring what I've learned to my craft to give it my own personal style. 

        </p>
